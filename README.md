# RaidSummon

## Update for Classic
I am currently rewriting the code for this addon, it may not working correctly right now  
When i am finished i will upload it to Curse / Twitch Client

## How it works
Only works in a raid group  
Someone types 123, summon or port in chat (say, yell, raid or whisper)  
This player gets added to the small RaidSummon frame and is synced accros all RaidSummon users  
SHIFT + LEFTCLICK to move the frame  
LEFTCLICK to target the player  
RIGHTCLICK to summon the player and send a message to him and the raid (messages can be disabled)  
CTRL+LEFTCLICK to remove the player(synced)  

If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /rs to show/hide it manually)  

Options:  
/rs help  
/rs zone (enabled/disables zoneinfo in /w and /ra) 
/rs whispers (enabled/disables whispering the target)
